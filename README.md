# **California Wildfire Damage Analysis - EDA**

## **Project Overview**
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the California Wildfire Damage dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors influencing wildfire severity.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset includes historical wildfire incidents with details such as:
- **Date** of occurrence
- **Location** of the wildfire
- **Area burned (Acres)**
- **Homes & businesses destroyed**
- **Injuries and fatalities**
- **Estimated financial loss**
- **Cause of wildfire**

## **Objectives**
- Identify **major causes** of wildfires.
- Analyze **seasonal trends** in wildfire occurrences.
- Examine the **impact on human lives and property**.
- Understand the **correlation between fire intensity and financial loss**.

## **EDA Steps Performed**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converted **date column** to datetime format.
   - Handled **missing values** and ensured data consistency.
   
2. **Exploratory Analysis & Visualizations**
   - **Bar Plot**: Top 10 most affected locations.
   - **Box Plot**: Distribution of injuries and fatalities.
   - **Count Plot**: Most common causes of wildfires.
   - **Heatmap**: Correlation between different features.
   - **Histogram**: Distribution of area burned.
   - **Line Plot**: Monthly trend of wildfire occurrences.
   - **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between homes & businesses destroyed.

## **Key Findings**
- **Human activity** is the leading cause of wildfires, followed by **lightning**.
- **October** sees the highest number of wildfires, indicating **seasonal trends**.
- **Shasta County, Sonoma County, and San Diego County** are among the most affected locations.
- **Larger wildfires generally result in higher financial losses**, but other factors also play a role.
- **Severe wildfires impact both homes and businesses, emphasizing the need for better mitigation strategies**.

## **Conclusion & Future Scope**
- The insights from this analysis can help **fire departments & policymakers** in resource allocation.
- **Predictive modeling** can be implemented to forecast wildfire occurrences.
- More **awareness campaigns & stricter regulations** are needed to reduce human-caused wildfires.
